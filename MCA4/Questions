Instructions

1. The solution to this assignment is expected to be submitted in the form of a python code.
2. Do not use absolute paths when loading data files.
3. Make good use of comments to explain your approach.
4. Your code should be readable and results reproducible.

Dataset

A folder "dataset" consists of a file station_day.csv, representing the air pollution data. You have to download that and extract all rows for StationId 'DL005'. You have to perform the following tasks on extracted dataframe only:

1.  (i)Are there missing values present in the extracted dataset? If yes, identify what fraction of observations have missing values and devise a strategy for the missing value handling. (ii) Generate Histogram visualizations for PM10,NO,SO2 and O3 features, what will you infer from generated outputs (explain that in comments). (iii) Extract values from rows 10 to 20 for column names PM10, NO2,SO2, O2 and AQI and write them in a list. 

2. (i) Split the extracted dataset in such a way that 80% is kept for training purpose and 20% is kept for test purpose. (ii) Do the Kmeans clustering on training set and predict the cluster of test dataset. (iii) Build a KNN model to classify categories of "AQI Bucket" and report the model performance on the test dataset with accuracy.
